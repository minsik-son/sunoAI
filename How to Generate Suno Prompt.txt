List of Metatags
What are Meta Tags?
Meta tags in music AI are directives that guide the AI in structuring songs, dictating styles, and integrating dynamics, thus allowing for detailed creative control and expression in generating music and lyrics. Think of meta tags as instructions or hints you give to the AI to help it understand exactly what kind of song you want to create.
How to Use Meta Tags in Suno AI
Using meta tags can significantly enhance the quality and precision of your AI-generated songs. Here’s how you can apply meta tags effectively:
1. Structuring Songs: Meta tags can help in defining the structure of your song. For example, you can use meta tags to specify the sections like intro, verse, chorus, and outro. This ensures that the AI understands the flow and progression of your song. Read more
2. Dictating Styles: Want your song to have a specific style or genre? Meta tags can guide the AI to produce music in the style of pop, rock, jazz, etc. You can even mix and match styles for a unique sound using meta tags. Learn how
3. Integrating Dynamics: Dynamics like volume, tempo, and emotion can be controlled using meta tags. You can tell the AI to make certain parts of the song softer or more energetic, adding a professional touch to your music with meta tags. Explore more
4. Creating Detailed Lyrics: Meta tags can also be used to fine-tune the lyrics. You can specify themes, rhyme schemes, and even the mood of the lyrics. This helps in generating coherent and meaningful lyrics that fit well with the music through the use of meta tags. Find out how
By mastering the use of meta tags, you can take full control of your music creation process, making sure the AI produces exactly what you envision.

How to Structure Prompts for Suno AI
Solution: To achieve consistent outcomes when prompting Suno AI for music generation, understanding and effectively structuring prompts is crucial. This ensures that the AI interprets your intentions accurately and the music aligns with your desired characteristics.
Examples:
1. Use Custom Mode and Detailed Descriptors: Instead of relying on the general input fields, switch to custom mode where you can specify each aspect of your music:
2. Genre: Heavy Metal, Mood: Dark, Key: B minor
3. This format helps prevent the AI from misinterpreting parts of your prompt as lyrics.
4. Separating Elements with Commas: When you want to combine multiple attributes like genre, voice, and instrumental emphasis, separating them with commas can clarify your intentions:
5. Gothic, Alternative Metal, Ethereal Voice
6. This method helps the AI differentiate between various stylistic elements.
7. Using Brackets for Specific Instructions: To ensure that specific instructions are followed, use brackets to define song sections or vocal styles:
8. [Verse1] [Female Ethereal Voice]
9. This helps in guiding the AI more precisely, especially when trying to emulate certain band styles or unique vocal characteristics.
Additional Tips:
* Experiment with different structuring formats to see which provides the best results for your specific style.
* Incorporate mood, tempo, and “ear candy” elements to enhance the overall appeal of the music.
* Remember, the more specific your prompt, the more likely the AI will produce the desired outcome.
Understanding how to effectively structure your prompts can significantly improve the consistency and quality of the music generated by Suno AI, turning your creative visions into reality.
